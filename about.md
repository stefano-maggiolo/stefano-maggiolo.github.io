Hello! My name is Stefano Maggiolo. Since November 2012 I live in London, where I am a software engineer for [Google][1].

Previously, I have studied Mathematics (in particular Algebraic Geometry) at the Universities of Ferrara and Pisa, and finally at [SISSA][2], where I got a Ph.D. in Geometry in October 2012.
