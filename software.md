The followings are some of my open source projects. Here are only minimal presentations; more information can be obtained clicking on their name (to search in the archives for news about them).

### CMS

A contest management system (that is, the software that manages a programming contest, from the submission of solution, to the grading and the ranking), built with the [IOI][1] in mind, but general enough for many programming contests.

See the [CMS homepage][2] or the sources at [GitHub][3].

### Pydoc checker

A tool to dynamically verify that the type annotations in a Python program are correct.

Sources on [GitHub][4].

### pydepgraph

A dependencies analyzer for Python.

Sources on [GitHub][8].

### Commu

A GUI to write commutative diagrams in [PGF/TikZ][5], obtaining a more pleasant output than with XY&#8209;Pic.

Download latest version [here][6], or the sources on [github][7].
