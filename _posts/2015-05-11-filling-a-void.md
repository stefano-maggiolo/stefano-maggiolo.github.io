In the [increasingly][1] populated [scene][2] of [London mapping][3] there was still something very basic missing.

London boroughs constitutes an important part of the administration of the city: they are responsible for many local services: school, social services (including housing), waste management, parks, and have a say also in the public transport. To fund them, resident pay a council tax which varies a lot between boroughs. Also, the elections for the borough council are the only one where non-citizen can vote, given their local scope.

One problem is that as of yesterday I had no idea how most boroughs were placed around London. Yes, you can easily find maps like the one on the right [on Wikipedia][4], but it is hardly informative: it is definitely too hard to navigate it without any landmark. An image search for [london borough map][5] also gives almost always highly stylized maps that do not show much more than just the boroughs' boundaries.

And honestly, there are not a lot of landmarks I would recognize outside of zone 2... wait, there are some: the tube stations! I rarely go outside zone 2 even with the tube, but I got used anyway to most names just by looking at the line maps while traveling. And this must be true for many people, because when I type "london borough map" on Google, on of the first completions it suggests is "with tube stations". Sadly, I could not find any map with this information, so I created it! You can see it on the left as a png (click to enlarge and download), or get the [pdf file][6]. The main source is of course Tfl's wonderful [tube and rail map][7], and just a couple of hours of Inkscape did the trick.
