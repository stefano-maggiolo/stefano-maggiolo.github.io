you, who, in a moment of desolation, when all those symbols blurred to your eyes, got here searching "I will never understand algebraic geometry". I'm writing to you, and the message is: don't worry, you're not alone! Don't give up! Just let the symbols blur, sweat on them, sleep on them, and then, it'll be just a matter of time. Let it pass, and you will woke up, some day, you will look at the same old symbols, and you won't see them anymore, you will see the *math* behind them, and it will take some minutes, before you realize that now you *understand*!

At least, everyone tells me it happens in this way.
