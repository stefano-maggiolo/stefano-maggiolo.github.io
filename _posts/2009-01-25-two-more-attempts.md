Again, wet-folding!

<!--more-->

This is the time for Montroll's bear: very small ratio original paper--resulting origami. It seems simple, but I had to try three times, because a misplacement at the beginning does the difference after the many folds needed for this bear.


The second is Yoshizawa's bunny: this is really simple, but as usual simple folds do not mean easy. Indeed I'm far from satisfied --- it lacks expression.
